## Three-Level Implementation Structure

### **Major Phase A: Foundation Infrastructure (2 weeks)**
*Build the core technical foundation with vector database and code embedding capabilities*

**Purpose**: Establish reliable, fast infrastructure for storing and retrieving code similarity vectors

**What You'll Build**:
- Smart database system that can instantly find similar code patterns
- AI system that understands code structure and meaning across different programming languages
- Integration layer that connects these systems seamlessly

**How It Works**: Think of building a super-fast librarian system that can instantly catalog and find books by content similarity, not just title or author

**Sub-Phase A1: Vector Database Foundation**
- Database connection and health monitoring system
- Data storage structure optimized for lightning-fast similarity searches
- Basic operations for storing and retrieving code fingerprints

**Sub-Phase A2: Code Embedding Foundation**
- AI model that converts code into mathematical representations
- Pipeline that processes different programming languages consistently
- Quality validation ensuring similar code produces similar fingerprints

**Sub-Phase A3: Integration Foundation**
- Seamless connection between database and AI model
- Error handling for when things go wrong
- Performance optimization for real-time responsiveness

### **Major Phase B: Core Detection System (2 weeks)**
*Build intelligent similarity detection and content processing capabilities*

**Purpose**: Create the "brain" that can understand code content and detect meaningful similarities

**What You'll Build**:
- System that reads and understands code structure across multiple languages
- Intelligence engine that can rank similarity from "exact duplicate" to "somewhat related"
- Automated scanning system that learns about your entire codebase

**How It Works**: Like having an expert developer who has memorized every file in your project and can instantly tell you "this looks 89% similar to that function in utils/parser.py"

**Sub-Phase B1: Content Processing Engine**
- Code parsing for Python, JavaScript, Bash, and Markdown files
- Structure extraction that understands functions, classes, and relationships
- Content normalization that focuses on meaning rather than formatting

**Sub-Phase B2: Similarity Detection Engine**
- Intelligent similarity scoring with configurable sensitivity
- Ranking system that considers multiple factors beyond just text similarity
- Multi-criteria assessment including syntax, semantics, and structure

**Sub-Phase B3: Codebase Intelligence**
- Automated scanning and indexing of your entire project
- Smart update detection when files change
- Performance optimization for large codebases

### **Major Phase C: Integration & User Experience (2-3 weeks)**
*Seamlessly integrate with Claude Code workflow and create intuitive user interactions*

**Purpose**: Make the duplicate detection feel like a natural, helpful part of Claude Code rather than an interruption

**What You'll Build**:
- Hook system that quietly monitors file creation and editing
- Friendly notification system that offers helpful suggestions
- Complete workflow integration that respects user preferences

**How It Works**: Like having a helpful colleague who notices when you're about to duplicate work and politely suggests "Hey, you already have something really similar - want to build on that instead?"

**Sub-Phase C1: Hook System Integration**
- Integration with Claude Code's internal workflow
- Context-aware triggering that knows when to check for duplicates
- Configuration system for user preferences and sensitivity settings

**Sub-Phase C2: User Experience & Workflow**
- Interactive notifications with clear options and recommendations
- User decision handling that respects choices and learns preferences
- Workflow optimization to minimize disruption while maximizing value

**Sub-Phase C3: System Orchestration**
- End-to-end integration testing and performance validation
- Production-ready deployment with monitoring and reliability features
- Final optimization for real-world usage patterns

## Test-Driven Development Methodology

### **The TDD Red-Green-Refactor-Review-Commit Cycle**

Every micro-phase follows this rigorous five-step process:

**Step 1: RED (Write Failing Test)**
- Start by writing tests that define exactly what the feature should do
- Run tests to confirm they fail for the right reasons
- Focus on clear, specific test cases that capture both normal and edge cases

**Step 2: GREEN (Minimal Implementation)**
- Write the simplest possible code that makes the tests pass
- Resist the urge to build more than necessary
- Focus on functionality, not elegance or optimization

**Step 3: REFACTOR (Improve Code Quality)**
- Clean up the implementation while keeping tests passing
- Improve readability, maintainability, and structure
- Add proper error handling and logging

**Step 4: REVIEW (Quality Assurance)**
- Submit code for comprehensive MCP review with specific focus areas
- Address all identified issues immediately
- Iterate with reviewer until satisfaction is achieved

**Step 5: COMMIT (Integration & Documentation)**
- Add tests to the pre-commit test suite
- Commit changes with descriptive messages
- Update project tracking with progress and any lessons learned

### **Quality Assurance Integration**

**MCP Code Review Strategy:**
- **Test Reviews**: Focus on coverage, edge cases, and test quality
- **Implementation Reviews**: Emphasize security, correctness, and performance
- **Refactor Reviews**: Assess maintainability and design patterns
- **Integration Reviews**: Validate system integration and documentation

**Review Standards:**
- Continue review cycles until reviewer indicates satisfaction
- Address all critical and major issues before proceeding
- Document all review feedback and resolutions
- Never skip review steps to save time
