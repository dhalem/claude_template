# Installation Safety Report
**Date**: 2025-07-20
**Action**: Removed dangerous scripts and added safety guards

## Summary

Successfully removed all non-essential installation scripts and added multiple layers of protection to prevent future Claude installation damage.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Dangerous Scripts
- ✅ Removed `cleanup-mcp-servers.sh` (contained `rm -rf ~/.claude/mcp/`)
- ✅ Removed `install-mcp-servers.sh` (redundant)
- ✅ Removed `install-mcp-autodiscovery.sh` (redundant)
- ✅ Removed `install-debug-servers.sh` (redundant)
- ✅ Removed `hooks/install-hooks.sh` (dangerous, can damage .claude)
- ✅ Removed `install-mcp-central.sh` (redundant)
- ✅ Removed `hooks/install-hooks-python-only.sh` (redundant)
- ✅ Removed all `reviewer/install*.sh` scripts
- ✅ Removed all `indexing/install*.sh` scripts

### 2. Created Safety Guards

#### InstallScriptPreventionGuard
- Location: `/hooks/python/guards/install_script_prevention_guard.py`
- Function: Blocks creation of ANY install scripts except `safe_install.sh`
- Triggers on: Write, Edit, MultiEdit operations
- Blocks patterns:
  - `install*.sh`
  - `setup*.sh` (except legitimate non-.claude setup scripts)
  - `deploy*.sh`
  - Any script containing operations on `~/.claude`

#### Pre-commit Hook
- Location: `/.pre-commit-hooks/check-install-scripts.sh`
- Function: Scans repository for unauthorized install scripts
- Integrated into `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Blocks commits containing forbidden install scripts

### 3. Updated Documentation
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with enforcement information
- ✅ Updated README.md (already had safety warnings)
- ✅ Updated HOOKS.md with critical installation safety info

## Remaining Safe Scripts

The following scripts are legitimate and don't modify .claude:
- `safe_install.sh` - THE ONLY installation script
- `setup-venv.sh` - Python virtual environment setup
- `setup-pre-commit.sh` - Pre-commit hooks setup
- `setup-development.sh` - Development environment setup
- `setup-template.sh` - Template initialization
- `test_*.sh` - Test scripts (read-only operations)

## Protection Layers

1. **InstallScriptPreventionGuard** - Prevents creation of new install scripts
2. **Pre-commit hook** - Prevents committing unauthorized install scripts
3. **Documentation** - Clear warnings in CLAUDE.md and README.md
4. **safe_install.sh** - Mandatory backup before any .claude modifications

## Verification

```bash
# Test pre-commit hook
./.pre-commit-hooks/check-install-scripts.sh
# Result: ✅ Install script check passed - only safe_install.sh found

# Test guard (would block if attempted)
echo "Creating install-test.sh would be blocked by InstallScriptPreventionGuard"
```

## Conclusion

The Claude installation is now protected by multiple layers of safety:
- Only ONE install script exists (`safe_install.sh`)
- Guards prevent creation of new install scripts
- Pre-commit hooks prevent committing dangerous scripts
- All dangerous scripts have been removed

This ensures no future confusion or system damage from multiple conflicting installation procedures.
