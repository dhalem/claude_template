# CRITICAL BUG REPORT: Text Injection from Unknown Source

## Bug Description

During an active Claude Code conversation, text from an unknown source was injected into the conversation that belonged to neither the user nor Claude.

## Injected Text
```
âŽ¿ CRITICAL: Test that playlist playbook advances through multiple tracks
```

## Context
- **Date/Time**: 2025-07-24 (ongoing conversation)
- **Working Directory**: `/home/dhalem/github/claude_template`
- **Active Task**: Testing and remediation of duplicate prevention system
- **Conversation Topic**: Claude development template testing, duplicate prevention, MCP servers

## Evidence of Injection

**Neither party wrote this text:**
1. **User confirmed**: "this came from you... not me, where did it come from?"
2. **Claude confirmed**: Complete conversation history shows no mention of playlists, music, or track playback
3. **Topic mismatch**: Conversation entirely focused on AI development tools, not media playback

**Actual conversation topics:**
- Duplicate prevention system testing
- Claude Code hooks and guards
- MCP server setup
- README documentation updates
- Test suite remediation

## Potential Impact

**Security Concerns:**
- Unknown text source suggests potential cross-conversation contamination
- Could expose sensitive information from other conversations
- May indicate broader context isolation issues

**User Experience:**
- Confusing and disruptive to ongoing work
- Breaks conversation flow and context
- Undermines trust in conversation isolation

## Technical Details

**Environment:**
- Claude Code CLI
- Linux 6.1.0-37-amd64
- Git repository: claude_template
- Python virtual environment active
- Working with hooks, MCP servers, and testing infrastructure

**Timeline:**
- Conversation focused on duplicate prevention testing
- Text appeared with no prior context or relation to ongoing work
- Both parties confirmed they did not write the injected text

## Reproduction

This appears to be a spontaneous injection - unclear how to reproduce. Suggests:
1. Cross-conversation bleed
2. Context contamination between sessions
3. Potential memory corruption or session mixing

## Expected Behavior

Conversations should be completely isolated with no text injection from unknown sources.

## Actual Behavior

Foreign text appeared in conversation that belonged to neither participant.

## Urgency

**Critical** - This suggests fundamental issues with:
- Conversation isolation
- Context security
- Session management
- Potential data leakage between users/conversations

## Request

Investigation into:
1. How unknown text entered the conversation
2. Whether this affects other users/conversations
3. What safeguards exist to prevent context contamination
4. Whether sensitive information could be exposed across conversations

This appears to be a serious security and reliability issue that warrants immediate investigation.
