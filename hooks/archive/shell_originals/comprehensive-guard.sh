# CLAUDE CODE COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY GUARD
# Section separator
#
# This script consolidates all safety hooks for Claude Code to enforce
# critical rules from CLAUDE.md and prevent costly mistakes.
#
# ADDING NEW GUARDS:
# 1. Add a new section below with clear header comments
# 2. Follow the same pattern: detect -> warn -> require permission
# 3. Use descriptive variable names and add comments
# 4. Test the new guard thoroughly before deployment
# 5. Update this header documentation
#
# CURRENT GUARDS:
# - Git No-Verify Prevention (PreventS bypassing pre-commit hooks)
# - Docker Restart Prevention (Prevents using old images after code changes)
# - Directory Awareness (Enforces pwd verification for location-dependent commands)
# - Test Suite Enforcement (Prevents completion claims without proper testing)
# - Mock Code Prevention (Blocks forbidden mock/simulation code - file operations only)
# - Pre-Commit Config Protection (Guards .pre-commit-config.yaml modifications)
