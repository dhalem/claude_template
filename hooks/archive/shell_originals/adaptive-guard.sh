# ADAPTIVE CLAUDE CODE SAFETY GUARD
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This script implements comprehensive safety protections for Claude Code by
# enforcing critical rules from CLAUDE.md to prevent costly mistakes that
# have caused real harm in documented incidents.
#
# KEY FEATURES:
# - Adaptive behavior: Works both interactively and non-interactively
# - Safety-first policy: Blocks dangerous operations by default
# - Comprehensive coverage: Protects against multiple types of mistakes
# - Clear guidance: Provides helpful alternatives for blocked actions
# - Battle-tested patterns: Based on documented real-world incidents
#
# GUARDS IMPLEMENTED:
# 1. Git No-Verify Prevention - Stops bypassing pre-commit hooks with --no-verify
# 2. Docker Restart Prevention - Prevents catastrophic restart after code changes
# 3. Pre-Commit Skip Prevention - Stops bypassing hooks with SKIP= environment variables
# 4. Hook Installation Protection - Blocks direct edits/copies, enforces install script usage
# 5. Docker Without Compose Prevention - Enforces docker-compose usage for container management
# 6. Git Force Push Prevention - Blocks dangerous force pushes that rewrite history
# 7. Mock Code Prevention - Blocks creation of mock/simulation code without permission
# 8. Container Rebuild Reminder - Reminds to rebuild after Docker file changes
# 9. Database Schema Verification - Reminds to check schema before writing queries
# 10. Temporary File Management - Suggests proper location for temporary scripts
# 11. [Extensible] - Easy to add new guards following established patterns
#
# DOCUMENTED INCIDENTS PREVENTED:
# - June 23, 2025: Audio incident from not checking volume
# - June 30, 2025: SMAPI service breakage from docker restart
# - Multiple incidents: Bypassed pre-commit hooks, incomplete testing
#
# USAGE:
#   Called automatically by Claude Code hooks system
#   Receives JSON input via stdin with tool execution details
#   Returns exit code 0 (allow) or 1 (block) to control tool execution
#
# CONFIGURATION:
#   Interactive mode: Prompts user for dangerous operations
#   Non-interactive mode: Uses safety-first blocking policy
#   Detection: Automatic based on TTY availability
#
# ADDING NEW GUARDS:
# 1. Add new section with clear header comments
# 2. Follow pattern: detect -> message -> get_user_permission -> exit
# 3. Use descriptive variable names and comprehensive error messages
# 4. Test both interactive and non-interactive modes
# 5. Update this header documentation
#
# OUTPUT CONSIDERATIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE:
# - Messages go to stdout and appear in Claude Code interface
# - stderr can be used for debug info (visible with Ctrl-R)
# - Clear, formatted output helps users understand blocking decisions
# - Provide actionable alternatives for blocked operations
#
# MAINTENANCE:
#   This script should be kept in sync with CLAUDE.md rules
#   Test after any changes to ensure all modes work correctly
#   Update documentation when adding new guards

            MESSAGE="üö® MOCK CODE DETECTED: Real integration required!

WHY MOCKS ARE FORBIDDEN:
  - Mocks provide false confidence in broken code
  - Hide real integration issues until production
  - Waste hours debugging \"working\" tests that fail in reality
  - Violate CLAUDE.md rule: MOCKS AND SIMULATIONS ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN

REAL EXAMPLES OF MOCK FAILURES:
  - Mocked database tests passed, real queries failed
  - Mocked API tests passed, real endpoints broken
  - Mocked file operations passed, container paths wrong

CORRECT APPROACH:
  1. Use real test databases (containerized)
  2. Use real API endpoints (test environment)
  3. Use real file systems (temp directories)
  4. Use real service integrations (docker-compose)

MANDATORY PERMISSION PROTOCOL:
  1. STOP immediately - Do not write mock code
  2. Ask user permission with detailed justification
  3. Get explicit written approval before proceeding

This rule exists because mocks have caused real production failures."
