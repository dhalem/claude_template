# RULE #0: MANDATORY FIRST ACTION FOR EVERY REQUEST
# 1. Read CLAUDE.md COMPLETELY before responding
# 2. Setup Python venv: [ -d "venv" ] || ./setup-venv.sh && source venv/bin/activate
# 3. Search for rules related to the request
# 4. Only proceed after confirming no violations
# Failure to follow Rule #0 has caused real harm. Check BEFORE acting, not AFTER making mistakes.
#
# GUARDS ARE SAFETY EQUIPMENT - WHEN THEY FIRE, FIX THE PROBLEM THEY FOUND
# NEVER weaken, disable, or bypass guards - they prevent real harm

# Pre-Install Hook Tests - Essential Checks Only
# TEMPORARY: Simplified to prevent hanging during commit
