# Hook Test Integration Summary

## ðŸ§ª COMPREHENSIVE HOOK TEST SUITE

All hook tests are now fully integrated into the main test runner (`run_tests.sh`) and execute as part of the mandatory full test suite.

## Test Execution Order

The hook tests run **FIRST** in the test suite as critical safety infrastructure:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ 1. Hook System Tests (MANDATORY - blocks commit if fails)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Pre-install tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Python hook tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Protection guard tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Installation verification tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Exit code fix tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Integration tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Protection guards integration tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Post-install tests (if hooks installed)
â”œâ”€â”€ 2. Indexing tests
â”œâ”€â”€ 3. Main project tests
â””â”€â”€ 4. MCP integration tests
```

## Integrated Test Categories

### âœ… Pre-Install Tests
- **File**: `hooks/tests/test_hooks_pre_install.sh`
- **Purpose**: Verify hooks work in development environment
- **Status**: MANDATORY - blocks commit if fails
- **Tests**: Essential file existence, critical functionality verification

### âœ… Python Hook Tests
- **Location**: `hooks/python/tests/`
- **Purpose**: Unit test all Python guard logic
- **Status**: MANDATORY - blocks commit if fails
- **Runs**: `pytest hooks/python/tests/ -v --tb=short`

### âœ… Protection Guard Tests
- **Pattern**: `hooks/tests/test_*_guard.sh` and `hooks/tests/test_*_guard.py`
- **Purpose**: Test individual protection guards
- **Status**: MANDATORY - blocks commit if fails
- **Includes**:
  - `test_anti_bypass_pattern_guard.py`
  - `test_precommit_protection_guard.sh`
  - `test_test_script_integrity_guard.sh`

### âœ… Installation Verification Tests
- **File**: `hooks/tests/test_installation_verification.sh`
- **Purpose**: Verify installation process works correctly
- **Status**: MANDATORY - blocks commit if fails
- **Tests**: Installation process, file permissions, JSON configuration

### âœ… Exit Code Fix Tests (CRITICAL)
- **File**: `hooks/tests/test_exit_code_fix.sh`
- **Purpose**: Verify guards return exit code 2 for blocking
- **Status**: MANDATORY - blocks commit if fails
- **Verifies**: The critical fix where guards were returning exit 1 instead of 2

### âœ… Integration Tests
- **File**: `hooks/tests/test_integration_simple.sh`
- **Purpose**: Test basic hook integration
- **Status**: MANDATORY - blocks commit if fails
- **Tests**: End-to-end hook workflow

### âœ… Protection Guards Integration Tests
- **File**: `hooks/tests/test_protection_guards_integration.sh`
- **Purpose**: Test protection guards working together
- **Status**: MANDATORY - blocks commit if fails
- **Tests**: Multiple guards, override mechanisms, complex scenarios

### âœ… Post-Install Tests
- **File**: `hooks/tests/test_hooks_post_install.sh`
- **Purpose**: Verify hooks work after installation
- **Status**: Optional (only if hooks installed)
- **Tests**: Installed hooks, override mechanisms, logging, stdin handling

## Test Execution Requirements

### MANDATORY Tests (All Must Pass)
- Pre-install tests
- Python hook tests
- Protection guard tests
- Installation verification tests
- Exit code fix tests
- Integration tests
- Protection guards integration tests

### Optional Tests
- Post-install tests (only if `~/.claude/python` exists)

## Failure Handling

**Any hook test failure blocks the entire commit:**
```bash
if ! test_hooks; then
    log_error "Hook tests FAILED - blocking commit"
    exit 1
fi
```

This ensures:
- No code is committed without working safety infrastructure
- All protection guards are functional
- Critical exit code fix remains working
- Hook system integrity is maintained

## Test Coverage Verification

The test suite covers:
- âœ… All protection guards individually
- âœ… Guard integration and interaction
- âœ… Installation and verification processes
- âœ… Critical exit code functionality
- âœ… Python guard system
- âœ… Stdin handling robustness
- âœ… Override mechanisms
- âœ… Logging functionality
- âœ… File existence and permissions

## Maintenance Requirements

**When adding new hooks:**
1. Create individual test in `hooks/tests/test_[hook_name].sh/py`
2. Test will be automatically picked up by protection guard test pattern
3. Add integration test scenarios if needed
4. Update documentation

**When modifying existing hooks:**
1. Ensure existing tests still pass
2. Add new test cases for new functionality
3. Verify integration tests still work
4. Update documentation as needed

## No Bypass Policy

**Hook tests CANNOT be bypassed:**
- No `--fast` mode skips hook tests
- No `@pytest.mark.skip` allowed in hook tests
- No `stages: [manual]` in pre-commit for hook tests
- Protection guards prevent test bypassing attempts

This ensures the safety infrastructure remains intact and functional at all times.

## Verification

To verify all hook tests are properly integrated, run:
```bash
./verify_test_integration.sh
```

This verification script confirms:
- âœ… All required hook tests are integrated into `run_tests.sh`
- âœ… Hook tests execute first (critical safety infrastructure)
- âœ… All test files exist and are executable
- âœ… Test failure blocks commit (proper error handling)
- âœ… Correct execution order maintained

## Historical Context

Hook tests were made mandatory after the critical incident where guards were returning exit code 1 instead of 2, causing them to fail to block dangerous operations. The comprehensive test suite prevents regression of this and other critical safety features.

The integration was completed to ensure NO hook test is ever missed in the build process, maintaining the safety infrastructure integrity.
